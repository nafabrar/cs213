1a)The difference between  "S7-static-call-reg.s" and "S7-static-call-stack.s" is that in the  "S7-static-call-reg.s" memory is not used for a stack however in the stack.s the function ping stores the \
return in the function on the stack unlike reg.s.\
1b)The advantage of the approach followed by stack is that since the return address is stored on stack,it can be used to make other function calls.As the return address is stored on the stack it is not lost.\
1c)The advantage of approach followed in reg is that it uses less memory since it is not storing \
on stack and hence would be faster.\
